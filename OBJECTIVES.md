##Project

###Write a program to list out local shoe stores and the brands of shoes they carry. Make a Store class and a Brand class.

    * _Create a database called shoes and a testing database called shoes_test, and remember to follow proper naming conventions for your tables and columns. As you create your tables, copy all MySQL commands into your README._

    * _Build full CRUD functionality for Stores. Create, Read (all and singular), Update, Delete (all and singular)._

    * _Allow a user to create Brands that are assigned to a Store. Don't worry about updating or deleting Brands._

    * _There is a many-to-many relationship between Brands and shoe Stores. Many Stores can carry many Brands and a Brand can be carried in many Stores. Create a join table to store these relationships._

    * _When a user is viewing a single Store, list all Brands that Store currently carries, and allow them to add another Brand to that store. Create a method to get the Brands sold at a Store, and use a join statement in it._

    * _When a user is viewing a single Brand, list all Stores that carry that Brand and allow them to add a Store to that Brand. Use a join statement in this method too._

    * _When you are finished with the assignment, make sure to export your databases and commit the .sql.zip files for both the app database and the test database at the top of your project directory._

##Objectives

    Does your Store class have all CRUD methods implemented in your app? That includes: Create, Read (all and singular) Update and Delete (all and singular).
    Are you able to view all the brands sold at a single store, as well as all the stores selling a particular brand?
    Is the many-to-many relationship set up correctly in the database?
    Did you use join statements?
    Are the commands on how to setup the database in the README? Did you include the .sql files?
    Are previous standards met? (See below)
    Is the project in a polished, portfolio-quality state?
    Does the application work as expected?
    Does the project demonstrate an understanding of all concepts from the week? If prompted, can you discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology?

Previous Objectives

    Do the database table and column names follow proper naming conventions?
    Were Twig template files used for all Silex pages?
    Is your logic easy to understand?
    Are all tests passing?
    Did you use descriptive variable names?
    Does your code have proper indentation and spacing?
    Did you include a README with a description of the program, setup instructions, a copyright, a license, and your name?
    Is the project tracked in Git, and did you regularly make commits with clear messages that finish the phrase "This commit willâ€¦"?
